		<h2 id='build'>Form Building</h2>
		<div>
			<div class='l40'>
				<p>To access the form builder, click on a form under <em class='surround'>Forms</em>. The form builder screen can be divided into two parts. The left part is the <em class='surround'>Dashboard</em> and the right part is our <em class='surround'>Form Preview</em>.</p>
				<h3>Dashboard</h3>
				<div>
					<ol>
						<li>List of Forms: Takes you back to the form index.</li>
						<li>Save: The form saves every 180 seconds. Nevertheless, you can click on <em class='surround'>Save</em> to manually save it any time.</li>
						<li>Form Options</li>
						<li>Styling: This allows you to customize the various elements of the form.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Below these options are the various form elements you can add. To add a form element, just click on the button.</p>
					<p>Captcha field cannot be added more than once in a form.</p>
					<p>You can embed Google Maps using the <em class='surround'>Custom</em> field. <a href='http://maps.google.co.in/help/maps/getmaps/plot-one.html' target='_blank'>Get the HTML link from Google Maps</a>, and paste it in the text box in the options for <em class='surround'>Custom</em> field.</p>
					<p>Follow the same procedure to embed videos, and other widgets.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Form Preview</h3>
				<div>
					<p>To view the options of the Form Title, Submit Button, or any added element, click on it.</p>
					<p>You can drag and drop the elements to change their order.</p>
					<p>The Live Form Preview tries to capture the form just as would appear on your WordPress page. However, the actual form might appear different depending on your WordPress theme, and other changes to basic CSS styles.</p>

				<h2 id='conditional'>Understanding Conditional Laws</h2>
				<div>
					<h3>Basics</h3>
					<p>You can use conditional laws to show / hide elements dynamically based on their value. However, conditional laws are not available for the following field types:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Choice Matrix
							</li>
							<li>
								Sliders
							</li>
							<li>
								Range
							</li>
							<li>
								Dividers
							</li>
							<li>
								Hidden Field
							</li>
							<li>
								Captcha
							</li>
							<li>
								Custom
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>How Show / Hide Works:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Show</strong><br>
									If a certain value is selected / entered in the input field, a specific element is shown. It is recommended that the element which is to be shown should be <strong>Hidden by Default</strong>, from the options of the respective element.
								</p>
								<p>Example: I have a field #3 which is to be shown when the value of the input field #1 is set to test. If the value test is typed in this field, the field #3 will be shown, but when I type in any value other than test, the field #3 will hide (whether or not it was Hidden by Default)
								</p>

							</li>

							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Hide</strong><br>
									If a certain value is selected / entered in the input field, a specific element is hidden.
								</p>
								<p>Example: I have a field #3 which is to be hidden when the value of the input field #1 is set to test. If the value test is typed in this field, the field #3 will hide, but when I type in any value other than test, the field #3 will be shown (whether or not it was Hidden by Default)
								</p>

							</li>


						</ol>
					</p>
					<h3>Specifics</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Fields: Star, Smiley, and Thumb
								</strong><br>
								Each selectable option of the fields Star and Smiley has a pre-defined value, from 1 to 5 (in case of Smileys) and 1 to 5 (or more, in case of Stars). If, say, you want to show field #3 when the lowest smiley rating is selected by the user, you will set the conditional law to
								<pre class='well' style='width: 90%'>if this element <span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px'>equals 1</span> <br>then <span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px'>show</span> <br>element <span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px'>3</span></pre>
								Thumb fields have two predefined values: 1 for the positive rating (thumb up) and 0 for the negative rating (thumb down)
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Fields: CheckBox, MultiChoice, and DropDown
								</strong><br>
								Unlike star, smiley and thumb ratings, the value of each option is customizable here, and the show / hide event is triggered when a specific option is checked. In case of checkboxes, where multiple options can be selected, the show / hide event will be triggered if a specific option is checked, whether or not other options are also checked.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Fields: Email, One Line Text, DateInput, and MultiLine
								</strong><br>
								The plugin also allows you to set conditional laws to text fields, and the show / hide events work live.
							</p>
								<p>Example: I have a field #3 which is to be hidden when the value of the One Line Input Field #1 is set to test. As soon as the value test is typed in this field, the field #3 will hide, but when I type in any value other than test, the field #3 will be shown (whether or not it was Hidden by Default)
								</p>
								<p>
									Isn't it awesome?
								</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Fields: File
								</strong><br>
								The value of the File field will be the number of files uploaded
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>New in FormCraft 2.0</h3>
					<p>The 2.0 update allows you to conditionally set the redirection path (the URL to which the user will be redirected on successful form submission), and email recipients, based on form values.</p>

				</div>

				<h2 id='submissions'>Form Submissions</h2>
				<p>When a user submits a form, the form data is delivered to the email recipients, and is saved in a database.</p>
				<p>Email recipients can be added under <em class='surround'>Form Options</em> inside the Form Builder screen.</p>
				<p>All the form submissions can also be accessed from the <em class='surround'>Submissions</em> table in the Form Index screen.</p>
				<p>On the same screen you can see statistics on form submissions.</p>
				<h3>Exporting Submissions</h3>
				<p>You can also export the form submissions under the tab <strong>Submissions</strong>, by selecting the relevant form from the dropdown and clicking on <strong>Export</strong></p>
				<h3>Searching Submissions <span>(new in 2.0)</span></h3>
				<p>You can use the Search Submissions field to search the submissions content. If you type in a keyword, like, <strong>sam</strong>, the search engine will match the word against form values as well as field names.</p>



				<h2 id='file'>File Manager <span>(revamped in 2.0)</span></h2>
				<p>
					As you might know, FormCraft has a fantastic <em class='surround'>File Upload</em> field feature for your forms. All the files uploaded by users can be viewed from the <em class='surround'>File Manager</em> table from the Form Index screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also access the uploaded files by viewing the form submissions data.
				</p>
				<p>
				The file upload field was revamped in 2.0. You can now set minimum and maximum file size, file types, and maximum number of files allowed.
				</p>

				<h2 id='support'>Support</h2>
				<p>
					In case of general queries or clarifications, you can post a comment in the Item Discussion section.
